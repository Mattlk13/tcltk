TkAqua Cocoa/64bit Port
=======================

Features yet to be implemented, in order of importance:

TODO for parity with Carbon TkAqua:
- clipboard (scrap) handling
- transient windows (stay in front of & move with parent window)
- window resize limits (max/min & increments)
- native file, alert & color picker dialogs
- Tcl callbacks for app hide & show
- reinit internal state when screen size changes
- transparent windows
- fullscreen windows

TODO features that are not in Carbon TkAqua yet either:
- native bitmaps (i.e. access to named OS-provided icons)
- native scale widget
- custom menu drawing (for tk menus with very fancy config options that native
  menus do not support)
- transparent window resize corner
- stippled drawing

Known Bugs:
- CoreText measuring bug seen in narrowed widget demo main window
