TkAqua Cocoa/64bit Port
=======================

Features yet to be implemented, in order of importance:

TODO features that are not in Carbon TkAqua yet either:
- script enabling of cocoa button metrics
- native bitmap creation for iconForFile, icon of specified size etc
- localized button names in native dialogs
- native scale widget
- modeless color picker
- custom menu drawing (for tk menus with very fancy config options that native
  menus do not support)
- support for sheets & drawers
- transparent window resize corner
- stippled drawing

Known Issues:
- still appear to need the call to [NSWindow windowRef] in XMapWindow()
  even though all WindowRef usage has been removed
